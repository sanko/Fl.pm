=head1 NAME

FLTK - Historical Package Name Alias

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use FLTK qw[:all];
    my $window = FLTK::Window->new(100, 100, 300, 180);
    my $box = FLTK::Box->new(FL_UP_BOX, 20, 40, 260, 100, 'Hello, World');
    $box->labelfont(FL_BOLD + FL_ITALIC);
    $box->labelsize(36);
    $box->labeltype(FL_SHADOW_LABEL);
    $window->end();
    $window->show();
    exit run();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The FLTK package is a namespace alias for the Fl package. It's only use is to
allow (most) code written for the old FLTK distribution to use the new Fl
package with a little less work. Please note that the toolkit itself is not
100% compatible so expect complex code written for FLTK to just plain kill
over on Fl even with this alias.

Again the two toolkits are not 100% compatible!
