=head1 NAME

Fl::LightButton - Push Button with a Light

=head1 Synopsis

    use Fl qw[:button];
    my $button = Fl::LightButton->new(0, 0, 100, 200, 'Hello, World!');
    $button->callback(sub {print q[It's dat boi]} );

=head1 Description

The Fl::LightButton class represents a button that displays the "ON" state by
turning on a light rather than drawing pushed in.

=for html <center><img src="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.3/Fl_Light_Button.png" /></center>

The shape of the 'light' is initially set to FL_DOWN_BOX. The color of the
light when on is controlled by C<selection_color()>, which defaults to
FL_YELLOW.

Buttons generate callbacks when they are clicked by the user. You control
exactly when and how by changing the values for C<type()> and C<when()>.

=head1 Methods

Fl::LightButton inherits Fl::Button and Fl::Widget. On top of that, it exposes
the following methods...

=head2 new(...)

    my $button_a = Fl::LightButton->new(0, 0, 250, 500, 'Important Stuff');
    my $button_b = Fl::LightButton->new(0, 0, 250, 500);

The constructor creates a new light button using the given position, size, and
label.

The default box type is FL_NO_BOX, which draws the label without a box to the
right of the light.

The C<selection_color()> sets the color of the  light. The default is
FL_YELLOW.

You can use C<down_box()> to chane the box type of the checkmark. Default is
FL_DOWN_BOX.

The destructor removes the button.
