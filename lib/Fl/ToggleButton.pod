=head1 NAME

Fl::ToggleButton - Button that Toggles On and Off

=head1 Synopsis

    use Fl;
    my $button = Fl::ToggleButton->new(0, 0, 100, 200, 'Hello, World!');
    $button->callback(sub {print q[It's dat boi]} );

=head1 Description

The Fl::ToggleButton class represents a button that needs to be clicked once
to toggle on and once more to toggle off.

The toggle button shows the "ON" state by drawing a pushed-in button.

=head1 Methods

Fl::RadioButton inherits from Fl::Button and Fl::Widget. On top of that, it
exposes the following methods...

=head2 new(...)

    my $button_a = Fl::ToggleButton->new(0, 0, 250, 500, 'Important Stuff');
    my $button_b = Fl::ToggleButton->new(0, 0, 250, 500);

The constructor creates a new button using the given position, size, and
label.

The button's C<type()> is set to FL_TOGGLE_BUTTON by default.

The destructor removes the button.
