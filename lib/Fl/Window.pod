=head1 Methods

In addition to inheriting from Fl::Group, this widget also supports the
following methods.

=head2 new(...)

The constructor creates a window of a given size and (optionally) position on
screen. The upstream API has a few poorly designed options:

    my $window_a = Fl::Window->new(300, 500);

This creates a window from the given size. You may also set the window's title
like this:

    my $window_b = Fl::Window->new(300, 500, 'Basic math');

If not provided, the window's title defaults to the filename of the current
running script.

You'll notice that the above examples don't define an on screen position. The
window manager is allowed to place the new window as it sees fit. To define a
position yourself, use either:

    my $window_c = Fl::Window->new(100, 150, 300, 500);

...or...

    my $window_d = Fl::Window->new(100, 150, 300, 500, 'Math is singular');

In these examples, the new window is placed 100 pixels from the left and 150
pixels down from the top of the display area.

=begin TODO

Ideally, we could also create windows with something like:

    my $window = Fl::Window->new(
        -position => [100, 100],
        -size     => [380, 400],
        -title    => 'NA'
    );

=end TODO

Again, the ($w, $h) form of the constructor creates a top-level window and
asks the window manager to position the window. The ($x, $y, $w, $h) form of
the constructor either creates a subwindow or a top-level window at the
specified location ($x, $y), subject to window manager configuration. If you
do not specify the position of the window, the window manager will pick a
place to show the window or allow the user to pick a location. Use
C<position($x, $y)> or C<hotspot()> before calling C<show()> to request a
position on the screen. See L<Fl::Window->resize()/resize(...)> for more
details on positioning windows.

Top-level windows initially have C<visible()> set to 0 and <parent()> set to
C<undef>. Subwindows initially have C<visible()> set to 1 and C<parent()> set
to the parent window pointer.

Fl::Widget->box() defaults to C<FL_FLAT_BOX>. If you plan to completely fill
the window with children widgets you should change this to C<FL_NO_BOX>. If
you turn the window border off you may want to change this to C<FL_UP_BOX>.

=pod

The destructor I<also deletes all children.> This allows a whole tree to be
deleted at once, without having to keep a pointer to all children in the user
code.

=cut

void
Fl_Window::DESTROY()

=pod

=head2 show()

Puts the window on the screen.

On X, this usually has the side effect of opening the display.

If the window is already shown, it is restored and raised to the top. This is
really convenient because your program can call C<show()> at any time, even if
the window is already up. It also means that C<show()> serves the purpose of
C<raise()> in other toolkits.

=cut

void
Fl_Window::show()

=pod

=head2 shown()

Returns non-zero if C<show()> has been called but not C<hide()>.

You can tell if a window is iconified with C<( $w->shown() && !$w->visible() )>.

=cut

int
Fl_Window::shown()

=pod

=head2 hide()

Removes the window from the screen.

If the window is already hidden or has not been hsown then this does nothing
and is harmless.
