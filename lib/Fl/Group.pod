=head1 NAME

Fl::Group - The FLTK Container Widget

=head1 Synopsis

    my $group = Fl::Group->new(100, 200, 340, 180);
    $group->begin();
    # Create new widgets here
    $group->end();

=head1 Description

Fl::Group is the FLTK container widget.

It maintains an array of child widgets. These children can themselves be any
widget including Fl::Group. The most important subclass of Fl::Group is
Fl::Window, however groups can also be used to control radio buttons or to
enforce resize behavior.

The tab and arrow keys are used to move the focus between widgets of this
group, and to other groups. The only modifier grabbed is shift (for
shift-tab), so that ctrl-tab, alt-up, and such are free for the app to use as
shortcuts.

=head1 Methods

Fl::Group is a subclass of Fl::Widget but also supports these methods:

=cut

#include <FL/Fl_Group.H>

MODULE = Fl::Group         PACKAGE = Fl::Group         PREFIX = Fl_

PROTOTYPES: DISABLE

=pod

=head2 new(...)

The constructor creates a group of a given size and position on screen or
within the parent.

    my $group_a = Fl::Group->new(100, 150, 300, 500);

...or...

    my $group_b = Fl::Group->new(100, 150, 300, 500, 'Math is singular');

In these examples, the new group is placed 100 pixels from the left and 150
pixels down from the top of either the display area or parent widget.

=begin TODO

Ideally, we could also create windows with something like:

    my $window = Fl::Group->new(
        -position => [100, 100],
        -size     => [380, 400],
        -title    => 'NA'
    );

=end TODO

=cut

Fl_Group *
Fl_Group::new(int x, int y, int w, int h, char * title = PL_origfilename)

=pod

The destructor I<also deletes all children.> This allows a whole tree to be
deleted at once, without having to keep a pointer to all children in the user
code.

=cut

void
Fl_Group::DESTROY()

=pod

=head2 C<add(...)>

    my $button = Fl::Button->new(...);
    $group->add($button);

Adds a widget to the end of this group. If the widget already has a parent, it
is first removed from that parent.

=cut

void
Fl_Group::add(Fl_Widget * widget)

=pod

=head2 C<add_resizable(...)>

    my $button = Fl::Button->new(...);
    $group->add_resizable($button);

Adds the widget to the group and makes it the resizable widget.

=cut

void
Fl_Group::add_resizable(Fl_Widget * widget)
    C_ARGS: * widget

=pod

=head2 begin()

Sets the current group so youcan build the widget tree by just constructing
the widgets.

    $group_a->begin();
    Fl::Box->new(100, 75); # Automatically added to $group_a

C<begin()> is automatically called by the constructor for Fl::Group (and thus
Fl::Window as well). <begin()> is exactly the same as C<Fl::current(...)>.
Don't gorget to C<end()> the group or window!

=cut

void
Fl_Group::begin()

=pod

=head2 C<children()>

Returns how many child widgets the group has.

=cut

int
Fl_Group::children()

=pod

=head2 C<child(...)>

    my $kid = $group->child(1);

Returns the N'th child of the group. Please not that no index checks are made.

=cut

Fl_Widget *
Fl_Group::child(int n)

=pod

=head2 C<clear()>

Deletes all child widgets from memory recursively.

This method differs from the C<remove()> method in that it affects all child
widgets and deletes them from memory.

=cut

void
Fl_Group::clear()

=pod

=head2 C<resizable(...)>

The resizable widget defines the resizing box for the group.

When the group is resized, it calculates a new size and position for all of
its children. Widgets that rae horizontally or vertically inside the
dimensions of the box are scaled to the new size. Widgets outside othe box are
moved.

In these examples, the gray area is the resizable:

=end html

The resizable may be set to the group itself, in which case all the contents
are resized. This is the default value for Fl::Group, although undef is the
default for Fl::Window and Fl::Pack.

If the resizable is undef then all widgets remain a fixed size and distance
from the top-left corner.

It is possible to achieve any type of resize behavior by using an invisible
Fl::Box as the resizable and/or by using a hierarchy of child Fl::Group's.

=cut

void
Fl_Group::resizable(Fl_Widget * widget)

=pod

=head2 end()

Any new widgets added to the widget tree will be added to the parent of the
group.

=cut

Fl_Group::end()
